# Team
Team Metafork is a 3 programmer team. We are trying to explore the joy of game making in our senior year of college and make something quirky while reaching some new territories we've never touched before.

I worked on this team as the UI/Tool/VFX/Networking programmer, some major contributions I had are:
- Steam Online Match making
- Chess ability VFX
- 3D main menu & gamepad navigation
